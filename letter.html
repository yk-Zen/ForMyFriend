    <h1>Your Special Letter</h1>
    <div class="letter-container">
      
       <p>Hi Zane, It's your Birthday now, isn't it? 🤭 Though I'm a bit late to greet you because the 17th has already passed... I’m sorry! I was having some trouble publishing this website, and by the time I finally solved it, it's already the 18th for you 😔... BUT ANYWAY! Being late isn’t the end! So, I’m writing this letter to express how grateful I am to know you! 🗣️❤️‍🔥🎉💯</p>

        <p>I'm really thankful that we’ve gotten closer, especially with Jay... even though we may not be as close as you and Jay, who honestly feel like siblings with your goofy vibes 🤣. You both crack me up kekeke 😹. But still, knowing you has also had a big impact on my life. Playing and chatting with you guys has made my days so much more joyful muehehe 😆 (I know, I sound cringe 😭🙏).</p>

        <p>You two are so funny lol. I hope we can keep chatting and playing together in the future. Actually, I really miss playing with you guys, since it’s been a while. And I also miss hearing your voices... especially Jay’s 😭❤️‍🔥✨. Jay says we’ll lose our hearing if we listen to her voice 😂😂, and I told her, “Why? I love hearing your voice!” Zane probably does too, right? 😭📈. I know you do 😭📈. Who wouldn’t like hearing Jay’s voice? It's adorable! Fr 😌🎧📈✨.</p>

        <p>At first, I was really surprised to hear you guys' voices because I didn’t expect we’d become this close. And it’s all thanks to Zane being brave 😆🙏 enough to start a voice call kekeke. I remember how nervous I was that day... ngek 🤦‍♀️. I’m not used to calling people, I’m always home, that's why haha. So yeah, I truly miss our playtime together... Even though I didn’t open my mic sometimes because I was shy 💀. Mane 😌🔫 hahaha... phew, I guess this turned into a message rather than a letter haha. I didn’t expect to share all my thoughts here 😹😹. But okay, let’s get serious now 😆...</p>

        <p>Whether we are far or near, our friendship has never known distance. It amazes me how close we've become over the months, even though we’ve never met in person. I may not be there to celebrate with you in person, but I hope you feel how much you’re appreciated and cared for today. You’ve made such a difference in my life, and so has Jay. You two are the longest friends I’ve known online, and I’m so grateful for your friendship. As you celebrate another year, know that no matter where life takes us, we’ll always have your back.</p>

        <p>Happy 17th Birthday, Zane! 🎉❤️‍🔥✨</p>
